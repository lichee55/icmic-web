                    ICMIC invites the submissions of original, unpublished research works that are currently not under review. Authors can submit a 1 or 2-page Work-in-Process (WIP) papers. Through Work-in-Progress papers, authors can share latest results with the research community. WIP papers emphasize the novelty of the work, not completeness. All submissions should be in PDF format, formatted with single-spaced, two-column pages using at least 10 pt (or higher) size fonts on A4 or letter pages following the standard IEEE conference templates.

            <div>
                <div class="inner">
                    All camera-ready submissions must be submitted electronically, in PDF format, and uploaded on EDAS. The
                    final camera-ready manuscript of your paper should account for all the critical reviewers’ feedback. The
                    maximum paper length is 2 pages, and papers exceeding 2 pages will not be accepted by EDAS. Proofread
                    your source document thoroughly as there will be no possibility for further revision.
                    All camera-ready manuscript submissions MUST be formatted with the standard IEEE conference templates.
                    Furthermore, in order for your paper(s) to be published in the ICMIC 2022 Conference Proceedings,
                    an author (including students) of an accepted paper is required to register for the conference
                    at the Full rate and must present the paper at the conference.
                    Once you have completed the preparation of your final manuscript and registration,
                    you can upload your final manuscript in EDAS. In the EDAS page of your
                    paper, select the “Final Manuscript” button and follow the instructions to upload the PDF file with the
                    final manuscript of your paper that has been previously obtained from PDF.
